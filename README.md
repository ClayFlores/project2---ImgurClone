# Features:

Can create and edit albums that user has submitted. Can view albums other people have submitted and favorite them, if desired. Can leave comments on albums and vote approval on comments others have left.

# To-do list:

Better website appearance with CSS or another aesthetic tool Optimization of some of the front end methods.

# Getting Started:

git clone https://github.com/ClayFlores/project2---ImgurClone.git

You will need to insert your own properties file with the information to connect to your database.
